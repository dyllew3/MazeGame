which is used to generate the maze.
The maze is drawn using the std draw library whoses authors' names can found in the class itself. The maze class currently generates a maze allows movement through the maze using  w,a,s,d keys the goal is to get from the bottom left hand corner of the maze to the top right hand corner of the maze which is marked with a green square.
