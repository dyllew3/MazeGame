# MazeGame
This repository is designed to create a maze game using java. In order to create a maze that always has a start point that
can reach the endpoint the grpah class is used. The graph class uses prim/kruskal's algorithm to create a minimum spanning tree
which is used to generate the maze.
THe maze is drawn using the std draw library whoses authors' names can found in the class itself. The maze class currently only generates a maze and doesn't allow for playing however that feature will be added soon!
